        <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted
          programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript has
          curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class
          functions.</p>
        <p>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide
          Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web
          applications. The vast majority of websites use it, and major web browsers have a
          dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.</p>

        <p>Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by
          Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code
          readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and
          object-oriented approach aims to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and
          large-scale projects.</p>

        <p>C# (pronounced C sharp) is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language
          encompassing strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional,
          generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming
          disciplines. It was developed around 2000 by Microsoft within its .NET initiative and
          later approved as a standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270:2018). C# is one of
          the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure.</p>

        <p>C# was designed by Anders Hejlsberg, and its development team is currently led by Mads
          Torgersen. The most recent version is C# 7.3, which was released in 2018 alongside Visual
          Studio 2017 version 15.7.2.

        <header>Rust</header>
        <p>Rust is a multi-paradigm system programming language focused on safety, especially
          safe concurrency. Rust is syntactically similar to C++, but is designed to
          provide better memory safety while maintaining high performance.
        </p>

        <p>Rust was originally designed by Graydon Hoare at Mozilla Research, with contributions
          from Dave Herman, Brendan Eich, and others. The designers refined the language
          while writing the Servo layout or browser engine and the Rust compiler. The compiler
          is free and open-source software dual-licensed under the MIT License and Apache License
          2.0.</p>

        <p>Rust was the "most loved programming language" in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey
          for 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019.</p>

      <!-- Assembly -->
      <section class='main-section' id='Assembly'>
        <header>Assembly</header>
        <p>An assembly language (or assembler language), often abbreviated asm, is any low-level
          programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the program's
          statements and the architecture's machine code instructions.
        </p>
        <p>Assembly code is converted into executable machine code by a utility program referred to
          as an assembler. The conversion process is referred to as assembly, or assembling the
          source code. Assembly language usually has one statement per machine instruction, but
          comments and statements that are assembler directives, macros, and symbolic
          labels of program and memory locations are often also supported.</p>

        <p>Each assembly language is specific to a particular computer architecture and sometimes to
          an operating system. However, some assembly languages do not provide specific syntax
          for operating system calls, and most assembly languages can be used universally with any
          operating system, as the language provides access to all the real capabilities of the
          processor, upon which all system call mechanisms ultimately rest. In contrast to assembly
          languages, most high-level programming languages are generally portable across multiple
          architectures but require interpreting or compiling.</p>

        <p>Assembly language may also be called symbolic machine code.</p>

        <h4>Notes</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>This example uses Intel syntax. AT&T syntax can be used to write the same message.
          </li>
          <li>Comments in Intel syntax are preceded by the <code>;</code> character. Among other
            differences, the <code>#</code> character is used in AT&T syntax.</li>
          <li>Notice how detailed this example is. Assembly lets you give very specific instructions
            to
            the computer!</li>
